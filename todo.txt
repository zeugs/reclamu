- make random values configurable via config file
- overtone frequencies instead of notes
	-> allow blue notes
- move accomp accords like notes (random up/down) instead of choosing random fitting accord note (possibly high distance)
	-> create config GUI
- use monophonic voice midi as input for accomp, then add actual acapella music
- make a riddle on YT, let a song play with so many changes that it becomes difficult to find out, what was used

- notes to image feature

~ java => groovy
+ accomp: likeliness to play longer notes
+ allow different scale systems (pentatonic etc.)
